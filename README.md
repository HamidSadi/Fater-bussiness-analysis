# Fater - Estimating Potential Revenue for Diaper Sales

## 📌 Project Overview
Fater is a data-driven project aimed at estimating the potential revenue for diaper sales in **Naples, Italy** by leveraging **socio-demographic, territorial, and commercial factors**. Through advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, we built a **Random Forest Regression model** to predict revenue potential across different zones.

## 📊 Data Pipeline
1. **Data Understanding**: Examined multiple datasets, including socio-demographic data, store data, and geographic information.
2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**:
   - Handled **missing values** and **outliers**.
   - Created new features such as **Population Score** to weigh zones based on diaper demand.
   - Encoded categorical data (e.g., store type, brand, and location).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed population distribution, store locations, and market potential.
   - Investigated correlations among features.
4. **Modeling & Evaluation**:
   - Implemented **Random Forest Regression**.
   - Achieved **R² = 0.832** and **accuracy of 91%** on test data.
   - Identified key factors influencing revenue, such as **brand importance, store size, and zone potential**.

## 💡 Key Findings
- **Stores with larger floor areas** and **highly populated zones** showed higher revenue potential.
- **Gravitational and socio-demographic factors** played a crucial role in diaper sales.
- **Random Forest** effectively handled outliers and provided reliable predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data analysis & visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning)
- **GeoPandas** (for geographical data analysis)

## 📁 Dataset
The project utilizes socio-demographic, store, and geographic data to derive meaningful insights.

## 🎯 Future Work
- Expand the analysis to other retail products.
- Experiment with **deep learning models** for better revenue predictions.
- Improve geospatial analysis by incorporating real-time store sales data.
